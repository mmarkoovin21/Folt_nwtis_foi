## Build and run

**It is required to have Java SE 23 edition and Apache Maven installed!**


To run project, position yourself in root directory of the project. Run command
```
mvn clean install
```

When all projects compile nad build,some docker configuration is needed. First, make internal docker network runing this command

```
docker network create --subnet=20.24.5.0/24 mreza_mmarkovin21
```
This will create internal subnet with adress 20.24.5.0\24 for all of our containers. You can check if network is created with command `docker network ls`.

After this, create docker volume with command

```
docker volume create svezak_mmarkovin21
```
in whic we'll copy the files from **podaci** folder with this command
```
sudo cp podaci/*.* /var/lib/docker/volumes/svezak_mmarkovin21/_data
```

Finally, run docker compose.yaml file
```
docker-compose up --build -d
```
